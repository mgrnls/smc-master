This repository contains some of the work that I completed as part of the Sound and Music Computing master at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. As all of the work was completed in Jupyter notebooks, you can view them in a nicer format using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org):
- [Mapping Genre Taxonomies](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mgrnls/smc-master/blob/master/amp/genre-taxonomies.ipynb)
- [Typical Phrases of Makam Music](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mgrnls/smc-master/blob/master/amp/makam-ngrams.ipynb)
- [Instrument Recognition](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mgrnls/smc-master/blob/master/mir/instrument-recognition.ipynb)
